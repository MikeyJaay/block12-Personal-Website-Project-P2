          <h1>Central Michigan University, Bachelor's</h1>
          <h2>August 2015 - May 2019</h2>
          <p>
            I attended Central Michigan (CMU) from Fall 2015 to Spring 2019. Like most, 18-year-olds I went to college for the first time having no idea what I wanted to do. This is where my habbit for trying differnet career paths was born. I started as a journalism major, thinking I wanted to write for IGN. Later, realizing I didn't want to be told what to write about for the rest of my life, switch to advertising, then while I liked parts of journalism and advertising, I didn't want my career to be so narrow doing one thing for the rest of my life. I finally declared my major in Integrative Public Relations (IPR). I chose IPR becuase it required me to take journalism, advertising, PR, marketing, business, and broadcast classes. I've always loved the idea of being well rounded and having experience in multiple professions. An IPR degree was the first step in my life-long journey to becoming a jack-of-all-trades.

          <h2>May 2019 - August 2019</h2>
          <p>
            Scott Fosgard (SFC) was my first (and only) internship. I started at SFC right after my final semster at CMU and this internship counted toward my required internship credit for my Bachelor degree. SFC was a 100% remote agency (before remote was cool) based out of Detroit, Michigan. I'm thankful to Scott Fosgard (CEO & Founder) for giving me the opportunity to experience what it's like to be a true PR professional and pitching media. SFC focused on serving global clients in the autonomus vehicle industry (my first taste of startups) where we worked with Journalist from the New York Times, Forbes, and Bloomberge. However, the experience also taught me that agency life wasn't for me and I wanted my work to be for one company and it's projects only.

          <p>
            After finishing my internship at SFC, I recieved an offer to work as a Product Marketing & Communications Associate at Domino's corporate HQ in Ann Arbor, Michigan. This was my full-time job that required having a degree. This was my first taste of what it was like to work with engineers and started my love for working on and building software products that impact users daily lives. I joined the Next Generate Store Systems team (NGSS), which was tasked with building a new poiont-of-sales sytem from the ground up. Domino's original POS system was built on Visual Basic from a third-party company (that was no longer in business) and Microsoft announced it would no longer support Visual Basic

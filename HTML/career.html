          <h1>Central Michigan University, Bachelor of Applied Arts</h1>
          <h2>August 2015 - May 2019</h2>
          <p>
            I attended Central Michigan (CMU) from Fall 2015 to Spring 2019.
            Like most, 18-year-olds I went to college for the first time having
            no idea what I wanted to do. This is where my habbit for trying
            differnet career paths was born. I started as a journalism major,
            thinking <br />
            I wanted to write for IGN. Later, realizing I didn't want to be told
            what to write about for the rest of my life, switch to advertising,
            then while I liked parts of journalism and advertising, I didn't
            want my career to be so narrow doing one thing for the rest of my
            life. I finally declared my major in Integrative Public Relations
            (IPR). I chose IPR becuase it required me to take journalism,
            advertising, PR, marketing, business, and broadcast classes. I've
            always loved the idea of being well rounded and having experience in
            multiple professions. An IPR degree was the first step in my
            life-long journey to becoming a jack-of-all-trades.

          <h2>May 2019 - August 2019</h2>
          <p>
            Scott Fosgard (SFC) was my first (and only) internship. I started at
            SFC right after my final semster at CMU and this internship counted
            toward my required internship credit for my Bachelor degree. SFC was
            a 100% remote agency (before remote was cool) based out of Detroit,
            Michigan. I'm thankful to Scott Fosgard (CEO & Founder) for giving
            me the opportunity to experience what it's like to be a true PR
            professional and pitching media. SFC focused on serving global
            clients in the autonomus vehicle industry (my first taste of
            startups) where we worked with Journalist from the New York Times,
            Forbes, and Bloomberge. However, the experience also taught me that
            agency life wasn't for me and I wanted my work to be for one company
            and it's projects only.

          <h2>November 2019 - October 2021</h2>
          <p>
            After finishing my internship at SFC, I recieved an offer to work as
            a Product Marketing & Communications Associate at Domino's corporate
            HQ in Ann Arbor, Michigan. This was my full-time job that required
            having a degree. This was my first taste of what it was like to work
            with engineers and started my love for working on and building
            software products that impact users daily lives. I joined the Next
            Generate Store Systems team (NGSS), which was tasked with building a
            new poiont-of-sales sytem from the ground up. Domino's original POS
            system was built on Visual Basic from a third-party company (that
            was no longer in business) and Microsoft announced it would no
            longer support Visual Basic. Being a part of an enterprise company
            like Domino's investing the time and resources to build a new
            product from the ground up was an experince I didn't realize was so
            valuable at the time. Working onsite during alpha test, talking with
            end-users along with creating training materials in confluence and
            product videos in the Adobe Suite made me fall in love with the
            process of building and refining software products.

          <p>
            Shortly after my 1-year-mark at Domino's, I decided to continue my
            educatoin and get my MBA. Seeing the complex in's and out's of what
            it was like working with various internal and external stakeholders,
            engineers, and product managers I felt obtaining an MBA would give
            me a mor well-rounded understanding of differnet business units.
            From May 2021 to December 2023 I worked on my MBA while working
            full-time taking between 2-3 classes per semester depending on my
            employment workload per quarter. My last semster in January 2024 I
            decided to join a full-time coding bootcamp and finish my final MBA
            semester at night.

          <h1>Veryable</h1>
          <h2>October 2021 - March 2022</h2>
          <p>
            With the SaaS industry exploding starting in 2018, I kept hearing
            the term SaaS Sales and it perked my interest. If you asked me when
            I was in college if I would ever take a sales job, my response would
            be a hard "no". Yet, once I join Veryable, I ended up have a 3-year
            tech sales career with many success stories and just as many
            failures; and I wouldn't change it for the world. Veryable is a
            gig-economy app for manufacturing business to leverage workes on a
            flexiable as-needed basis, similar to how Uber allows users to use
            drives on an as-needed basis. My time at Veryable was short, but
            impactful for my development. It gave me the sales, bug, I had this
            uncontrollable itch to prove I could be a top-performing sales rep,
            however, I knew it wouldn't be at Veryable. Veryable's business
            model was more about the concept than the software, and my interest
            was and has always been around the software. I wanted to sell
            impactful software products, and I found that the manufacturing
            industry wasn't for me. The biggest lesson I learned at Veryable is
            the idea that "You have to believe in what your selling", this idea
            is obsurdly wrong. To be a truly successful sales rep, beliveing in
            what yourseling is easy, you have to be excited to talk about what
            you're selling. I found that excitment at Codility.

          <p>
            The highlight of my tech sales career. Codility is a technical
            assesment platform that helps hiring teams evaluate engineering
            applicants coding skills to hire the best talent faster (ironic that
            I ended up becoming a software engineeer, I know). Not a day goes by
            when I think back to my Codility days and not smile. I made
            life-long friends and mentors here that allowed me to solidify my
            selling and stakeholder managment skills. Starting on the inbound
            SDR team handling consoltatoin calls with customers, to being
            promoted to the outbound team (fastest in company history) and
            becoming the top performer, I learn that no one succeeds 100% on
            their own. I owe so much of my success to the friends and mentors I
            gained at Codility; their guidence and support, will carry on for
            the rest of my professional career.

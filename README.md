"This is the start of my personal website! The goal is to communicate my career journey before learning how to code and how my previous experiences impact my view on programming today. My hope is to demonstrate how my years of experience in public relations, product marketing, tech sales, and time at three different SaaS start-ups give me a unique outlook on the future of software engineering."
